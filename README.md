Handy Bird
=========

Play Flappy Bird by actually flapping your hands. 

I was totally amazed by [Daniel Rapp's demo](https://github.com/DanielRapp/doppler) that its possible to detect hand movement using the doppler effect in javascript. Given that I must make everything into a game, Flappy Bird was the obvious choice. 
Nebez Briefkani had already created a great javascript version, [Floppy Bird](https://github.com/nebez/floppybird).
