Play Flappy Bird by actually flapping your hands.

*Note:* You must allow the page to use the microphone, and ideally have your sound volume at maximum. You should flap your hand in the direction of the microphone on your computer. The speaker or microphone on some computers may not be able to handle the 20kHz tone used for the doppler detection. 

I was totally amazed by [Daniel Rapp's demo](https://github.com/DanielRapp/doppler) that its possible to detect hand movement using the doppler effect in javascript. Given that I must make everything into a game, Flappy Bird was the obvious choice. 
Nebez Briefkani had already created a great javascript version, [Floppy Bird](https://github.com/nebez/floppybird). Excellent code in both projects enabled this mash-up.
