Notes
==
* Does not work in Firefox. Tested and works in Chrome.
* Sound must be on and maximized. You may hear the high-pitched tone it uses.
* Microphone access must be allowed. It listens to the change in the tone to detect motion.
* Flap your hand toward your microphone. You may have to Google where it is on your computer.
* The speaker or microphone on some computers may not be able to handle the 20kHz tone used for the doppler detection.

History
==
I was totally amazed by [Daniel Rapp's demo](https://github.com/DanielRapp/doppler) that its possible to detect hand movement using the doppler effect in javascript. Given that I must make everything into a game, Flappy Bird was the obvious choice. 
Nebez Briefkani had already created a great javascript version, [Floppy Bird](https://github.com/nebez/floppybird). Excellent code in both projects enabled this mash-up.
